# Problem 1 - ferryboat
### Solution:
- Employ a binary search to efficiently find the optimal cost for ferry transport.
- At the lowest cost end, assign the maximum weight for a car, ensuring the final cost is minimal.
- At the highest cost end, allocate the total sum of car weights.
- Use binary search to check if distributing the final cost evenly among ferries is optimal. Adjust costs accordingly.

### Code:
- Utilize a binary search function to find the optimal cost for ferry transport.
- Read inputs, calculate total weight and maximum weight, then call the binary search function to find the optimal cost.

# Problem 2 - nostory
### Solution:
- For the first task, maximize score by pairing the largest numbers from both lists.
- For the second task, maximize score by swapping the smallest maximum with the largest minimum, given a number of moves.

### Code:
- Read inputs and call the corresponding task function.
Task 1: Sort and sum the largest numbers.
Task 2: Find the minimum and maximum of all pairs and accumulate the positive differences up to a given number of moves.

# Problem 3 - sushi
### Solution:
- Adapt the knapsack problem with infinite volume for tasks 1 and 2.
For task 3, expand the problem to accommodate adding N objects to the backpack.

### Code:
- Read inputs and call each function accordingly.
Task 1 & 2: Calculate average values for plates and their prices.
Task 3: Adjust the problem to handle adding N objects to the backpack.

# Problem 4 - signals
### Solution:
- Solve using dynamic programming with recurrence relations between steps.
- For both tasks, relate the current number of bits with specific counts of 1s to the previous steps.

### Code:
- Construct and initialize the DP matrix.
- Implement recurrence relations for both tasks, considering various combinations of 1s in binary strings.

# Problem 5 - badgpt
### Solution:
- Recognize the Fibonacci sequence in the results and compute the nth Fibonacci number for consecutive n letters of n or u.
### Code part:
- Call the function to find the nth Fibonacci number for consecutive n letters of n or u.
